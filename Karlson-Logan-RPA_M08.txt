A. Email:
I use both the University email system and the Canvas messaging system. I will respond to your email to
the address it was sent from and from the system it was sent from (if you email me from within Canvas, I
will respond to Canvas, if you email me from traditional email, I will respond with traditional email). For
class announcements I will send a Canvas group email via Announcements. I will be checking my email
frequently and you can expect a response within 48 hours (holidays excluded).
